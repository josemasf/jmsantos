# üÉè Deck Cards

This project is the core to generate decks of cards and manage a basic logic of use.

## Installation

```
npm i @josemasf/deck-cards
```

## Creating & Using a Deck

Create a basic deck without suits

```
const deck = new Deck(20);
```

Create an advanced deck with several suits. For example a Spanish deck

```
const deck = new Deck(10,4);
```

## Inspect the Deck

We can perform various actions on the deck

## Top

Get the first card on top

```
const first = deck.top();
```

Also we can pick some number of cards in the top

```
const firstFive = deck.top(5);
```

## Shuffle

We can shuffle the deck and randomize the positions, because by default the array go from 1 to max length adding 1 number by position

```
const first = deck.shuffle();
```

## Discard

You have the possibility of discarding a card, we can specify the position to discard or let it be random if we do not provide any

```
const random = deck.shuffle();

const firstFive = deck.shuffle(5)
```

## Get number of card available

```
const deckAvailable = deck.len();
```

## Get number of card used

```
const random = deck.used();
```

## Get suits setted

```
deck.suits;
```

## Get card by suit setted

```
deck.cardsBySuit;
```
